# Reader---A-Cold-Reading-Software
This project is a simplified version of the PHP Cold Reading reader presented by Giacomo De Carlo in the appendix of the Italian edition of *Manual of Cold Reading* (published in 2007 as *Manuale di Cold Reading*) by Ray Hyman, published by the association CICAP (Comitato Italiano per il Controllo delle Affermazioni sulle Pseudoscienze). Giacomo De Carlo published his code in a book and encouraged experimentation, indicating that any computer equipped with the software would be able to perform readings of the future, and directing those unfamiliar with programming to the CICAP website.

This code is released under the **GNU General Public License v3.0** license to promote learning, experimentation, and sharing, in line with Giacomo De Carlo's original intent.

**Description:**

The PHP code generates a personalized "future reading" based on user input (name and date of birth). It uses predefined phrases organized into categories (general, love, health, work) and calculates a "lucky number" based on the date of birth. The output is presented in a simple HTML format.

**Technologies Used:**

*   PHP
*   HTML
*   CSS (file `style.css`)

**Installation:**

1.  Save the PHP code in a file (e.g., `index.php`).
2.  Save or create a CSS file named `style.css` (optional, to customize the appearance).
3.  Ensure you have a web server with PHP installed (e.g., Apache, Nginx with PHP-FPM).
4.  Place the `index.php` and `style.css` files in the root directory of your web server.

**Usage:**

1.  Access the `index.php` file through your browser (e.g., `http://localhost/ColdReading/index.php`).
2.  Enter your name and date of birth in the form.
3.  Click on "Via alla tua lettura" (Go to your reading) to generate the reading.
4.  To get a new reading, click on "Nuova lettura" (New reading).

5.  **Notes:**

*   This code is for demonstration and educational purposes, based on the principles of Cold Reading.
*   The phrases used are predefined and do not represent a true prediction of the future.
*   The "lucky number" is an arbitrary calculation based on the date of birth.
